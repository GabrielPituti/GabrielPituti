🚀 Engineering Logic meets Generative AI

</div>

👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer (6+ years) specialized in critical mission systems for the Government sector. My background is built on solid Engineering principles (Java, Spring Boot, Oracle, Legacy Modernization).

Currently, I am pivoting my career towards AI Engineering, applying my architectural experience to build autonomous agents, RAG systems, and scalable AI solutions.

🔭 I’m currently building: MentorIA (An AI-Powered Productivity OS).

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced RAG patterns, LangChain, and Agentic Workflows.

💡 Superpower: Bridging the gap between robust legacy architectures and bleeding-edge AI innovation.

🧠 Featured Project: MentorIA (In Progress)

A "Waze for Life" — High-performance biological operating system.

Since my corporate work (Government/Banking) is under NDA/Private, MentorIA is my public playground for AI Engineering.

🏗 Architecture & Tech Stack:

Core: Python & TypeScript.

AI Engine: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for personalized context + Autonomous Agents for active monitoring.

Orchestration: n8n workflows integrated with LLMs (Gemini/OpenAI).

Frontend: Next.js (React) for the visual dashboard.

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) + Vector Store concepts.

Development: Accelerated using Cursor and Windsurf (AI-First IDEs).
